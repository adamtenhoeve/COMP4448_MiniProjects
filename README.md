# COMP4448_MiniProjects
5 Mini-Projects written during Summer Quarter of Data Science Tools 2 course.

The Mini-Projects are all machine-learning projects where I took a dataset, cleaned it, analyzed it, fit a model to it, and evaluated the results.

The projects include algorithms for:
1. Linear Regression
2. Clustering and Logistic Regression
3. Naive Bayes with NLP
4. Decision Trees
5. K-Nearest Neighbors
